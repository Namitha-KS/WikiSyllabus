## Module 1

### 1. Introduction to Economics

The term "Economics" is derived from the Greek word "IOKONOMIA," meaning household management. Adam Smith, known as the Father of Economics, introduced the seminal work "Wealth of Nations" in 1776. Economics examines how society and individuals allocate limited resources to meet unlimited wants. Business Economics, a specialized branch, applies economic concepts, methods, and theories to solve practical business problems and to make informed business decisions.
